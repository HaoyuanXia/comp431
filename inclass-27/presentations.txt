1. Which presentation was the most polished and delivered, and why?
   Pei Chen’s presentation about "AngularJS4" was the most polished and delivered.
   He presented a problem first, and introduces the available methods to handle the problem.
   Besides that, he also compared among all the available methods in different aspects.

2. Which topic did you learn the most from and what did you learn?
   I learned most from Tong Zhou’s topic --- React Native.
   Before her persentation, I only know React Native is a concept, or just a feeling generated during using the product. From her persentation, I knew what React Native is. This will inspire me to use React Native to develop my own product.

3. Which talk did you like the best and why?
   I like Dai Li's talk best. He has a louder vioce than other presenter. He slides is very clear, so I can follow his talk closely. From his talk, I have a brief idea on the features of NodeJS and Nginx and the pros and cons of it. Therefore, I like his talk best.
